# Overview

paperwallet-d is a cryptocurrency paper wallet generator written in D.  It is intended to easily support multiple currencies, as there currently are no multi-currency paper wallet generators out there.  Also, a key goal is to make sure this code is secure and reviewed so that it can be trusted for the sensitive nature of creating a secure way to store crytpocurrency.
